## Data Cleaning Using SQL

### Project Description

This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare raw data using SQL for analysis. The process includes removing duplicates, standardizing inconsistent values, handling nulls, and dropping unwanted columns to ensure a reliable and consistent dataset.

### Steps Involved

**1. Remove Duplicates**
Identify and delete duplicate rows using `GROUP BY` or `ROW_NUMBER()` functions.

**2. Standardize Data**
Format text consistently (e.g., lowercase/uppercase), correct inconsistent entries, and trim extra spaces.

**3. Handle Null Values**
Detect null or missing data using `IS NULL`. Replace them with default values or remove the rows.

**4. Remove Unwanted Columns**
Drop unnecessary columns that do not contribute to the analysis.

### Outcome

The dataset becomes clean, consistent, and ready for reporting or visualization.

### Technologies Used

* Database tools: MySQL Workbench.
